### How to Pipe arguments to a bash script    ...or bash aliases or bash functions.


##### `pargs` is a single script for people who want to pipe lines of arguments to bash functions or aliases.

If we want the hard way, we can always call bash code from xargs like [this,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11003418/calling-shell-functions-with-xargs) But
do we really want to?

Why not make it really easy?    
`$ cat lines_of_data | pargs some_bash_function`    
And it works with any new bash function- as soon as we export our bash function or 
update our alias in `~/.bash_aliases`

##### Installation: 
Install `pargs` by downloading the single script, making it executable and putting it in `~/bin`    
The script should work on any Linux with bash installed.  pargs works as a wrapper around bash, and works with any code you can run in bash.

##### bargs.sh is now available for people who don't want to export variables, functions, or add those functions to ~/.bashrc
simply replace command like `$ pargs command < file` with `$ . bargs.sh command < file`

    USAGE: pargs [options]... COMMAND [command options and arguments]... 
    	pargs reads each line of STDIN as an argument to pass to COMMAND
    
    ( The first non-option is always read as the COMMAND then it's args )
    pargs calls COMMAND with the intial arguments, followed by the arguments 
    from STDIN. 
    
    Here's a typical xargs example:
     $ echo x|xargs echo
    Which opens xargs with the output from the first echo, and calls the 
    second echo with a single argument 'x'.
    
    Here's a typical pargs example:
     $ echo type|pargs type 
    Which opens pargs with the output from echo, and calls the 'type' 
    bash built-in with a single argument 'type'. 
    
    Unlike xargs, the command arguments to 'pargs' can be an normal command, 
    bash function or alias.
    
    This program calls bash, tells bash to source ~/.bash_aliases, then always
    calls your command, function, or alias.  Exported bash functions work on
    exported bash variables, but only if they've been exported.
    
    	-1 		same as --max-args=1 in xargs or GNU parallel.  
    			pargs will read all input lines, but calls command
    			repetitively with a single argument, instead of 
    			multiple arguments.
    
    	-i 		The program will ignore errors.  Since 240 lines 
    			are passed as args at once, this is only useful if
    			your program ignores errors as well.
    
    	--help		Prints this message.
    
#### Examples: 
    
##### Each line is a url:
     pargs < url_list.txt youtube-dl --get-title	
##### ffprobe needs single arg:
     find -type f -regex '.*mp4'|pargs -1 ffprobe	
##### Use the ll alias for ls to list all media files with full path: 
     find -type f -printf "$PWD/%P\n"|grep -aiE '(\.mp4|\.webm)$'|pargs ll
##### Use the ll alias, but inside a bash function that was exported from the current shell:
     dope () { ll "$@";}; export -f dope; find -regex .*webm|pargs dope
##### unicode
     echo HON\ _\ à¸«à¸¡à¸²à¹‚à¸«à¸”\ à¸”à¸¸à¸”à¹‰à¸§à¸¢\ \!\!\!\!\ HPR\ GAMER\ Replay\ \[\ Gemini\ \]\ \[zStN\]Koomanp\ ðŸ‘Œ-uh6DJ-0h-i8.webm |pargs diff -s HON\ _\ à¸«à¸¡à¸²à¹‚à¸«à¸”\ à¸”à¸¸à¸”à¹‰à¸§à¸¢\ \!\!\!\!\ HPR\ GAMER\ Replay\ \[\ Gemini\ \]\ \[zStN\]Koomanp\ ðŸ‘Œ-uh6DJ-0h-i8.webm 
##### use the output of `locate` to show an abbreviated version of video metadata
     mlocate -ir the.two.towers|grep -iE 'mp4|mkv'|pwhat -i1 2>&1 ffprobe |perl -ne 'print if /Stream|Input|Duration/'
#### use a youtube playlist to move every file with the youtube ID to the current directory
     fn () { find 2>/dev/null -type f -printf "$(pwd)/%P\n"|grep -ai --; } export -f fn; youtube-dl --get-id 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eq48cz0Skk&list=PLx6N3LVwgba0rcUWHxuD2ivRCgcLmKEjp'|pargs -1 fn |pargs mv -t . 
#### use a youtube playlist to rename each file with 01, 02, 03... prefixes in order
     fn () { find 2>/dev/null -type f -printf "$(pwd)/%P\n"|grep -ai --; } export -f fn; youtube-dl --get-id 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eq48cz0Skk&list=PLx6N3LVwgba0rcUWHxuD2ivRCgcLmKEjp'|pargs -1 fn |pargs tracknumber2.pl
#### simple and useless example of interactive bash function. uses a bash built-in to show a menu that exits with control-c or EOF. 
     simple() { select CMD in echo 'rm -iv' stat;do $CMD "$1";done;return 0; };export -f simple
     find -mindepth 1|pargs -1 simple
#### find + move to trash
     find expression # then select lines with mouse to put on Xwindows 'primary selection' 
     xclip -o|pargs trashcan.sh  # trascan.sh is something like trash-cli, just moves all dirs or files to a trash folder.
     xsel|xargs -d\\n mv -vt /mnt/good_trash/  # same as above but with GNU xargs, and xsel instead of xclip, and an ad hoc trash directory instead of the GNOME trash system
#### select lines with mouse, put every line into an argument for arbitrary command
     ~~(xclip outputs each line  selected with the mouse for use with your command)
     xclip -o|pargs something.sh
     xclip -o|xargs -d\\n something.sh  # don't need pargs if it's a normal command
     alias selection-as-arguments='xclip -o|pargs'  # use same as above, easier to type

#### use GNU locate to create a quick 'directories only' playlist.  Create a playlist of each path that matches the regular expression.
     remove_non_dirs () { for a;do test -d "$a" && echo "$a";done;return 0;  };export -f remove_non_dirs # notice we never return an error.
     mlocate -ir 'deadly.duo'|pargs remove_non_dirs  # preview the list
     mlocate -ir 'deadly.duo'|pargs remove_non_dirs|mpv --playlist=-

#### use xargs to pass a long url to a command so you don't have to single-quote it by hand.
     alias get_vid='xsel -b |xargs -d "\n"  youtube-dl -q -f 18 --no-playlist -- 2>/dev/null;echo xargs returns $?' 
     ( same thing in two parts with pargs ) 
     alias cl-args='xclip -o -selection clipboard|pargs'
     ( put below line into  ~/.bash_aliases so that pargs can call it, or export the bash function) 
     function get_18 { youtube-dl -q -f18 --no-playlist -- "$@" 2>/dev/null ||echo unknown failure&true; }  # silent failure is a bug
#### use pargs to search through large number of zip files to find a filename that matches a regular expression. 
     export REGEX='face of disgrace'
     zinfo_re () { for a;do zipinfo -1 "$a" | grep -aiE "$REGEX">/dev/null&& echo "$a";done;true; } ;export -f zinfo_re
     find -iname '*.zip'| pargs zinfo_re
#### same as above, but ignore error from 'grep' and use a single zipfile at a time.  The new search operation requires pargs to '-i' ignore error, and '-1' one arg per function call 
     export REGEX='face of disgrace'
     zinfo_re () { zipinfo -1 "$1" | grep -aiE "$REGEX" >/dev/null && echo "$1"; } ;export -f zinfo_re
     find -iname '*.zip'|pargs -1i zinfo_re
#### use pargs to shorten a bash script so that you don't need a bash for loop.   this script crops every image file losslessly with jpegtran
     crop_jpeg () { BN=`basename "$1"`; jpegtran -crop 1296x2096+32+24  "$1" > "crop_$BN"; };export -f crop_jpeg
     find .|pargs -1 crop_jpeg        # same as this wrapper:  for a in *; do crop_jpeg "$a";done
#### use find to match '.\*Waldge.\*.mp3', but pass to a bash function to select only files before a certain total duration.  This effects a sleep function for mpv.  The bash function simply calls mediainfo to get the time of a file in ms.  It keeps a running total of the seconds, but just prints each file in the argument list until the total exceeds the bash variable sleepyminutes
     export sleepyminutes=39; sleepy_accum () { (sleepyseconds=$((sleepyminutes * 60)); for a; do ss=`mediainfo --Inform='General;%Duration%' "$a"`; ((sleepy_a = sleepy_a +  (ss / 1000)));echo "$a"; if [[ "$sleepy_a" -gt "$sleepyseconds" ]]; then exit;fi;done;) }; export -f sleepy_accum; mpv --playlist=<(find -regex .*Waldge.*mp3 -printf "$PWD/%P\n" |pargs sleepy_accum)
>Nothing really to see here. You can replace the process substitution with `findXXX|mpv --playlist=-` and using `while read;do` in the above bash script would make the pargs call unnecessary.    
>So actually pargs isn't exactly vital here, but we're using pargs to use a script written for `script arg1 arg2 arg2...` and pargs allows us to use the script without refactoring the script into a bash loop with `while read`. So it's a normal use case.

#### FYI 
* As mentioned above, pargs always operates like `xargs --delimiter='\n'`.
* pargs always gives the command an interactive tty, just like `xargs --open-tty`. 
* if standard input is nothing but empty data lines, pargs simply exits without error. xargs runs the exact same way if  called with `xargs --no-run-if-empty`.    
* Blank lines are currently ignored.  Because empty arguments of "" "" "" is not what is desired.    
* xargs always stops command execution when the command encounters an error.  pargs works the same, but allows an option to ignore error: `-i`    
* pargs doesn't calculate the maximum command length from the environment like xargs, but instead keeps it rather low.    
* `pargs echo '$variable'` will not work since pargs will single quote `$variable` for the echo command.  You can use exported **variables**, but each exported **variable** you use will need to be used in a wrapper function or script, and not progammatically in the argument list for the command called by pargs.


Bugs: `pargs sudo customthing` (for functions and scripts in ~/bin) will not work since sudo needs normal commands, and doesn't use the $PATH for the user, but $PATH for root. Sudo should work inside scripts though.
